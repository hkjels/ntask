# Todo


__Tip: Create a taskpool similar to this one at the root of your project for rapid planning__


*	TODO #Research how one can track hours. Tracking labels for changes like #hours[n] ?  

*	TODO #github #thub todo-github should be able to add/modify/delete issues  

*	TODO Add #config possibilities  
  | Using .todoconfig in HOME or in the project-root  

*	TODO Closing tasks should be possible through the use of keywords (CLOSE|CLOSES|CLOSED|FIXES|FIXED)  
	| or by manually removing them from the code. Closed tasks should still exist  
	| in the index, but be compacted if it stays closed for a longer period of time.  

* OPTIMIZE GUI to perform somewhat realtime


_Note: If you come up with other clever ways of organizing and using "todo", please tell me._
