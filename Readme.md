# Todo - Work in progress (Launch @ 1st of March)

### Taskmanagement, your way!

__Main goal is to make your inline-todos more useful. This is achieved by 
giving your task labels; With labels you can easily sort and filter your tasks 
by priority, date and so on. The output should be friendly towards other 
issue-trackers, so one does not exclude the other.__
