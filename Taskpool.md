# Todo


__Tip: Create a taskpool similar to this one at the root of your project for rapid planning__


*	TODO #Research how one can track hours.  
  | Could possibly be done by tracking labels for changes.  
  | Or maybe by having a unit-column. It could then be possible to use timers.  

*	TODO @henrik Add #config possibilities #v[0.0.4]  
  | Using .todoconfig in HOME or in the project-root  

* FIXME Write tests!! Ensure that old-style todo's really are logged  
  | I have heard that code-coverage is a good idea aswell  

* BUG Database can end up corrupted at times #imd[2371b070]  

*	TODO Closing tasks should be possible through the use of keywords
  | (CLOSE|CLOSES|CLOSED|FIXES|FIXED)  
	| or by querying for tasks with a remove-flag  

* OPTIMIZE GUI to perform somewhat realtime  

* TODO Add stemming for improved fulltext searches  


_Note: If you come up with other clever ways of organizing and using "todo", please tell me._
