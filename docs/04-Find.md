## Find

__The power of ntaskÂ´s find-command is what really makes ntask shine.__

***

### @Assignee

Prefix your name with an "@"-symbol and you'll get a list of tasks sorted
by date, that are yours.

    t find "@$(whoami)"

Tasks that are not assigned to anyone specific will land under the assignee
@none. This means you can easily manage a taskpool by just querying:

    t find "@none"

__You can also use the alias @unassigned.__

***

### Labels

Labels come in two forms. The keyword that the task was prefixed with
(TODO | OPTIMIZE | BUG | FIXME) and words starting with a hash-symbol. The
latter can also have brackets that store a scalar value. This value can be
filtered and sorted upon.

    t find "#pri[>3]*"

In the example above I have suffixed the label with an asterix, that selects
the label for sorting. This is useful in conjunction with the --reverse flag
for ascending sorts. You can also see that there's filtering being done here
using brackets, so "pri"-labels with a numeric value of less than three will
not be displayed.

### Options

    -f, --format [string]

    The format-string is a sprintf-like implementation of all the
    properties of a task.

    %A - Assignee
    %B - Body
    %H - Label (#hash)
    %I - Id
    %K - Keyword
    %L - Line
    %T - Title

    -r, --reverse
